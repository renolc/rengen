# rengen

A tiny but flexible canvas game engine.

## NOTE

This is very pre-release. It technically works, but will probably undergo several major changes before I'm ready to slap a `1.0.0` version on there, so use at your own risk. Current testing is done exclusively on latest stable Chrome.

I'm mostly uploading to make it easier for me to iterate on and utilize for my 1GAM challenge (you can follow my progress on [my blog](https://renolc.github.io)).
